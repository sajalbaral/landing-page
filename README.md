# landing-page

Created a basic landing page.

This project reinforced the following skills:

1. Creating the structure of the web page using HTML, defining the different sections and elements. Then, applying styles using CSS to achieve the visual design provided by the Odin Project.
2. Setting up a Git repository to version control for my project. Regular commits will help me track changes.
3. I'll be interpreting a design and implementing it on the web. This involves understanding layout, spacing, typography, and color choices.
4. Using Google and other resources to look up information and solutions for specific challenges I may encounter.
5. Responsive design (to a limited extent)
